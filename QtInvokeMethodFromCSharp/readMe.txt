Test Environment£ºWin7£¬VS2013£¬Qt5.7.1 MSVC2013 32bit

Step:
1.build VS2013/CSharpDll
2.build VS2013/CppDll 
3.build Qt/TestCSharpDll
4.remember to copy the CSharpDll.dll and CppDll.dll generated by VS2013 to the path which is the same as your generated Qt executable file.


notice: modify the line '#pragma comment(lib,"E:/SourceCode/Qt/TestCSharpDll/CppDll.lib")' in mainwindow.cpp, you can change the  absolute path of lib to meet your own environment£¬for the separator of the absolute path better use the "/" rather than "\"(because "\" would be recognized as esacpe string by some compilers)
